Hi, I’m Alex, co-founder of SynthOrg. 
We build virtual organ models to reduce wet-lab assays for toxicity prediction.

My background is physics at ETH Zurich and ML systems at DeepMind. 
We started the company after seeing pharma teams struggle with simulation workflows. 
Our current traction includes two pilots, one with a biotech in Boston and one with a European pharma.

The main challenge is validating our organoid models quickly enough. 
Our approach is to layer mechanistic priors with generative diffusion models.

We’re raising 1.2M to productize the pipeline and expand the dataset.

I’m confident we can replace 20 percent of in vitro assays within 18 months.
