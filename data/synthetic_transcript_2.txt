Hey Marisa, thanks for taking the call. 
I’m Daniel, CEO of BioNovaX. 
We’re basically building the future of drug discovery through AI. 
Think of us like “the next DeepMind for biology” but more flexible.

We started the company because pharma is inefficient. 
Our model solves that by reducing the need for experiments. 
It’s an LLM for biological systems. 
We haven’t published the spec yet because it’s proprietary, 
but we believe it will outperform everything on the market 
once we complete a few more internal tests.

My background is a mix of biology and business. 
I did a biotech bootcamp, then worked at a startup that used machine learning 
for agriculture. 
I wasn’t directly involved in the modeling, but I saw how powerful AI can be.

At the moment, we’re in discussions with several large pharma companies. 
I can’t share names because the NDAs aren’t finalized, 
but they’re all very excited. 
One head of R&D apparently said our approach could “change the way the industry works” 
but I don’t want to overpromise. 
Still, we’re confident that once we close the first deal, 
growth will accelerate rapidly.

We haven't generated wet-lab data yet, mainly because we're trying to find 
the right CRO partner. 
We had one lined up, but they suddenly increased prices, 
so we're considering doing things in-house, which I think will give us 
better control anyway.

In terms of competition, we don’t see any real direct competitors 
because our model is unique. 
Most players are either too academic or too focused on a single modality. 
Our approach is multimodal from day one.

For fundraising, we're thinking of raising 6M although the exact amount is flexible. 
We need capital primarily for hiring a lead ML engineer and a senior scientist. 
We haven’t hired those roles yet, but we believe we can attract top talent 
once we have funding.

Happy to go deeper if helpful.
